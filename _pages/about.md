I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematics at **Brown University**, supervised by Prof. [**Javier Gómez Serrano**](https://sites.brown.edu/jgs/). My research focuses on the intersection of **partial differential equations**, **machine learning** and **computer-assisted proofs**.

I graduated with a **Master's degree in Mathematics** from UPC in May 2024 and **Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and in Informatics Engineering** from UPC in May 2023 as part of the [**CFIS**](https://cfis.upc.edu/ca) program.

For my **Master's thesis** I worked on _machine learning methods in incompressible fluid dynamics_, supervised of Prof. Javier Gómez Serrano and Prof. [**Tere M-Seara**](https://web.mat.upc.edu/tere.m-seara/). I completed my *Bachelor's thesis* during a visting year at NYU, and I worked on *multiscale modeling of a closure problem using the scattering transform*, supervised by Prof. [**Joan Bruna**](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/).

During my undergraduate studies, I was a [**Maria Yzuel Fellow**](https://www.icfo.eu/studies/internship/fellowships/maria_yzuel_fellowships/) in [**Antonio Acín’s group**](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/437/) at ICFO, and I had summer internships at Google in 2020 and 2021.

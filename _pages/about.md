I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematics at **Brown University** under the supervision of Prof. [**Javier Gómez Serrano**](https://sites.brown.edu/jgs/). My research lies at the intersection of **partial differential equations**, **machine learning**, and **computer-assisted proofs**.

I graduated with a **Master's degree in Mathematics** from UPC in May 2024, and I hold **Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and in Informatics Engineering** from UPC as part of the [**CFIS**](https://cfis.upc.edu/ca) program, awarded in May 2023. For my **Master's thesis**, I worked on _machine learning methods in incompressible fluid dynamics_ under the supervision of Prof. Javier Gómez Serrano and Prof. [**Tere M-Seara**](https://web.mat.upc.edu/tere.m-seara/). In my final undergraduate year, I was a visiting student at NYU, where I worked on my **Bachelor’s thesis** on *multiscale modeling of a closure problem using the scattering transform*, under the supervision of Prof. [**Joan Bruna**](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/).

During my undergraduate studies, I was a [**Maria Yzuel Fellow**](https://www.icfo.eu/studies/internship/fellowships/maria_yzuel_fellowships/) in [**Antonio Acín’s group**](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/437/) at ICFO, and I had summer internships at Google in 2020 and 2021.

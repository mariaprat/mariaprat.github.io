I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematics at Brown University, supervised by Prof. [Javier Gómez Serrano](https://sites.brown.edu/jgs/). My research focuses on the intersection of **partial differential equations**, **machine learning** and **computer-assisted proofs**.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Mathematics from UPC in May 2024 and Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and in Informatics Engineering from UPC in May 2023 as part of the [CFIS](https://cfis.upc.edu/ca) program.
